Description: The classical two-sample t-test only fit for the normal data.
    The tcfu() and tt() tests implemented in this package are suitable for 
    testing the equality of two-sample means for the populations having 
    unequal variances. When the populations are not normally distributed,
    these tests can provide more power than a large-sample t-test using normal
    approximation, especially when the sample sizes are moderate. The tcfu() 
    uses the Cornish-Fisher expansion to achieve a better approximation to the 
    true percentiles. The tt() transforms the Welch's t-statistic so that the 
    sampling distribution become more symmetric. More technical details please
